# ft_printf
This is my implementation of the ft_printf project from 42 school.

Description :

ft_printf is a function that mimics the behavior of the C library function printf(). 
It takes a format string as input and produces output according to the format specifier in the format string. 
The function can handle various data types such as strings, characters, integers, and pointers.
